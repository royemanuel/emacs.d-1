# My emacs config

The idea and organization for this is shamelessly stolen from 
[abreda/emacs.d](http://github.com/crnixon/emacs.d) who in turn borrowed it from
[@crnixon's emacs.d](http://github.com/crnixon/emacs.d). It is an
attempt at having a literate emacs config. There is also an
[html exported version](http://abedra.github.com/emacs.d)

# I am not an expert

I HIGHLY recommend going to the source if you like what you see.
